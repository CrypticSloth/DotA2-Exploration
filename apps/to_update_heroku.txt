Type in this command to push updates to heroku repo

git subtree push --prefix apps heroku master

We do this because heroku expects the app to be in the root directory.
We can use the subtree module to only push the subdirectory to get around this.

To push to the heroku server on a fresh system

First download heroku from their website
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up

then create a heroku account and login with
heroku login

then add your app to the git remote
heroku git:remote -a yourapp

then you can push it!

If you have multiple apps in the same repo and you want to update a different app run this to target it:
heroku git:remote -a dota-player-gold

If you are trying to push to a subtree make sure you checkin to the correct branch and then push how you normally would
