**Future Analysis Ideas**

- Movement analysis on teams to find patterns in their movement
- Find out what strategy works best for the current meta (splitpush, 5 manning, etc.)
- Maybe find new movement strats with unsupervised learning

	* Thoughts:

		* Use the two features (time and location) and for every second plot those on map (probably whole team)

		* Since the data is in two dimensions we can easily graph and run unsupervised learning to group the movements of the team.

		* When the movements are grouped we can look at it and identify some common movements that teams do.

			* Maybe even map these movements onto a dota map for easy identification and visualization (woudld be neat for a final visualization report)

- Relation to number of wards placed and winrate in lower mmr games (where sometimes few wards will be placed in a game)

- Some kind of draft analysis, find what heros play together the best etc using machine learning

	* Maybe first just find the team comps that have the highest avg winrate
	
    * Association rules (apriori)

- Relationship between toxic chatting and winrate

	Analysing certain teams patterns.
