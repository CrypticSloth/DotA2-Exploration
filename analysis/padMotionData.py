def padMotionData(data, faction = "", match_id):
    '''
    Function to sift through team movement data (from the function search_matches_for_team in collectTeamData.py).
    Returns a pandas dataframe with cleaned and padded movement data
    Padded means that motion is added to each players data because the api does not count the coordinates for each second
        where the player is not moving (only updates new movement coordinates) the padding fills in that missing data.
        The data is also padded at the last second as there were some discrepancies between each player at the end, each
        player did not end at the same time (probably due to each player logging out at different times)

    Inputs:
        data (required) - the data should be the return of the function search_matches_for_team
        faction (optional) - either 'radiant' or 'dire'
        game_id (optional) - if there is a specific match_id you are looking for inside the data collected you can put it here

    Outputs:
        A dictionary of dataframes of movement data, split into radiant and dire.
